## üéØ Summary

The CORS issue that blocked previous developers has been resolved by switching from absolute URLs (`https://domain.com/cart/add.js`) to relative URLs (`/cart/add.js`). This allows the app to work in all contexts while preserving the excellent 1-cent pricing hack and comprehensive order details.

**The fix is ready for production deployment! üöÄ**
